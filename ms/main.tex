%%% Introduction
\section*{Introduction}
Cooperative behavior can reduce an individual's fitness and increase the fitness of its conspecifics or competitors~\citep{axelrod1981evolution}.
Nevertheless, cooperative behavior appears to occur in many non-human animals~\citep{dugatkin1997cooperation}, including primates~\citep{jaeggi2013natural},  rats~\citep{rice1962altruism}, birds~\citep{stacey1990cooperative,krams2008experimental}, and lizards~\citep{sinervo2006self}.
Evolution of cooperative behavior remains an important conundrum in evolutionary biology. Since the work of  \citet{hamilton1964genetical} and \citet{axelrod1981evolution}, theories for the evolution of cooperative and altruistic behaviors have been intertwined often under the rubric of \emph{kin selection}.

Kin selection theory posits that natural selection is more likely to favor cooperation between more closely related individuals.
The importance of relatedness to the evolution of cooperation and altruism was demonstrated by \citet{hamilton1964genetical}, who showed that an allele that determines cooperative behavior will increase in frequency if the reproductive cost to the actor that cooperates, $c$, is less than the benefit to the recipient, $b$, times the relatedness, $r$, between the recipient and the actor. This relatedness coefficient $r$ measures a probability that an allele sampled from the cooperator is identical by descent to one at the same locus in the recipient.
This condition is  known as \emph{Hamilton's rule}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hamilton_rule}
c < b \cdot r.
\end{equation}

\citet{Eshel1982} studied a related model for the evolution of cooperative behavior.
Their model included \emph{assortative meeting}, or non-random encounters, where a fraction $m$ of individuals in the population each interact with an individual of the same phenotype, and a fraction $1-m$ interacts  with a randomly chosen individual.  
Such assortative meeting may be due, for example, to population structure or active partner choice.
In their model, cooperative behavior can evolve if\footnote{In an extended model, which allows an individual to encounter $N$ individuals before choosing a partner, the righthand side is multiplied by $E[N]$, the expected number of encounters \citep[eq.~4.6]{Eshel1982}.
} 
\citep[eq.~3.2]{Eshel1982}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eshel1982}
c < b \cdot m \,,
\end{equation}
where $b$ and $c$ are the benefit and cost of cooperation. 
Here $m$ in inequality~\ref{eq:eshel1982} takes the role of the relatedness $r$ in inequality~\ref{eq:hamilton_rule}.

The role of assortment in the evolution of altruism was studied by \citet{Fletcher2009assortment} in a \emph{public goods} game.
They found that for altruism to evolve, cooperative individuals must experience more cooperation, on average, than defecting individuals, and ``thus, the evolution of altruism requires (positive) assortment between focal \emph{cooperative} players and cooperative acts in their interaction environment.''
This condition can be summarized by \citep[eq.~2.3]{Fletcher2009assortment}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fletcher2009}
c < b \cdot (e_C - e_D ) \,,
\end{equation}
where $e_C$ is the probability that a cooperator receives help, and $e_D$ is the probability that a defector receives help.\footnote{inequality~\ref{eq:fletcher2009} generalizes inequality~\ref{eq:hamilton_rule} and inequality~\ref{eq:eshel1982} by substituting $e_C=r + p$, $e_D=p$ and $e_C=m + (1-m)p$, $e_D=(1-m)p$, respectively, where $p$ is the frequency of cooperators.}


In this paper we study the evolution of a cooperative behavior that is subject to \emph{cultural transmission}, which allows an individual to acquire attitudes or behavioral traits from other individuals in its social group through imitation, learning, or other modes of communication \citep{cavalli1981cultural,richerson2008not}.
\citet{feldman1985gene} introduced the first model for the evolution of altruism by cultural transmission.
They demonstrated that if the fidelity of cultural transmission of altruism is $\varphi$, then the condition for evolution of altruism in the case of sib-to-sib altruism is \citep[Eq.~16]{feldman1985gene}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:feldman1985}
c < b \cdot \varphi - \frac{1-\varphi}{\varphi} \,.
\end{equation}
In inequality~\ref{eq:feldman1985}, $\varphi$ takes the role of `relatedness' ($r$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:hamilton_rule}) or `assortment' ($m$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:eshel1982}), but the effective benefit $b\cdot \varphi$ is further reduced by $(1-\varphi)/\varphi$. This shows that under a combination of genetic and vertical (parent-to-offspring) cultural transmission, the condition for the evolutionary success of altruism entails a modification of Hamilton's rule (\autoref{eq:hamilton_rule}).

Cultural transmission may be either viewed as vertical, horizontal or oblique:  vertical transmission occurs between parents and offspring, horizontal transmission occurs between individuals from the same generation, and oblique transmission occurs  to offspring from the generation to which their parents belong (i.e. from non-parental adults). 
Evolution under either of these transmission models can be be more rapid than under pure vertical transmission~\citep{cavalli1981cultural,lycett2008questions,ram2018evolution}.
Both \citet{woodcock2006significance} and \citet{lewin2017microbes} demonstrated that non-vertical transmission can help explain the evolution of cooperative behavior (the former using simulations with cultural transmission, the latter using a model where cooperation is mediated by microbes that manipulate their host's behavior.) 
Some of the analyses by \citet{lewin2017microbes} can be applied to cultural transmission, because models of cultural transmission are mathematically similar to those for transmission of infectious diseases~\citep{cavalli1981cultural}.

Here, we study cultural-evolution models of cooperation that include both vertical and non-vertical transmission. 
We investigate these models using mathematical analysis and simulations.  
In our models behavioral changes are mediated by cultural transmission that can occur specifically during social interactions.
For instance, when there is an association between the choice of partner for social interaction and the choice of partner for cultural transmission.
As another example, when an individual interacts with an individual of a different phenotype, this exposure to a different phenotype may lead it to learn or convert its phenotype.
Our results demonstrate that cultural transmission can enhance the evolution of cooperation even when genetic transmission cannot (partly because it facilitates the generation of assortment in the sense of~\citet{Fletcher2009assortment}).
This further emphasizes that treatment of cooperation as a cultural trait, rather than a genetic one, can lead to a better understanding of its evolutionary dynamics.

% Models
\section*{Models}

Consider a very large population whose members are characterized by their phenotype $\phi$, which can be of two types, $\phi=A$ for cooperators or $\phi=B$ for defectors.
An offspring inherits its phenotype from its parent via vertical transmission with probability $v$ or from a random individual in the parental population via oblique transmission with probability $(1-v)$. 
Following~\citet{ram2018evolution}, given that the parent phenotype is $\phi$ and assuming uni-parental inheritance, % TODO cite Zefferman Behav Ecol 2016
the conditional probability that the phenotype $\phi'$ of the offspring is $A$ is 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:vertical_oblique_transmission}
P(\phi'=A \mid \phi) = \begin{cases}
v + (1-v)p, & \text{if } \phi=A \\
(1-v)p, & \text{if } \phi=B
\end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $p=P(\phi=A)$ is the frequency of $A$ among all adults in the parental generation.  

Not all adults become parents due to natural selection, and we denote the frequency of phenotype $A$ among parents by $\tilde{p}$.
Therefore, the frequency $\hat{p}$ of  phenotype $A$ among juveniles (after selection and vertical and oblique transmission) is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:horizontal}
\begin{aligned}
\hat{p}
& = \tilde{p} [v + (1-v)p] + (1-\tilde{p}) [(1-v)p] \\
& = v \tilde{p} + (1-v) p.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Individuals are assumed to interact according to a \emph{prisoner's dilemma}.
Specifically, individuals interact in pairs; a cooperator suffers a fitness cost $0<c<1$, and its partner gains a fitness benefit $b$, where we assume $c<b$. \autoref{table:prisoner_payoff} shows the payoff matrix, i.e. the fitness of an individual with phenotype $\phi_1$ when interacting with a partner of phenotype $\phi_2$.

Social interactions occur randomly:
two juvenile individuals with phenotype $A$ interact with probability $\hat{p}^2$, two juveniles with phenotype $B$ interact with probability $(1-\hat{p})^2$, and two juveniles with different phenotypes interact with probability $2\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})$. 

Horizontal cultural transmission occurs between pairs of individuals from the same generation. 
It occurs between social partners with probability $\alpha$, or between a random pair with probability $1-\alpha$ (see~\autoref{fig:horizontal}).
The assortment rate $\alpha$ is therefore the fraction of population that receives (horizontal transmission) from the social interaction partner, and $1-\alpha$ receives randomly.
Horizontal transmission is not always successful, as one partner may reject the other's phenotype. The probability for successful horizontal transmission of phenotypes $A$ and $B$ are $T_A$ and $T_B$, respectively (\autoref{table:interactions}).

Therefore, the frequency $p'$ of phenotype $A$ among adults in the next generation, after horizontal transmission, is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nextgen_adults}
\begin{aligned}
p'
& = \hat{p}^2 [\alpha + (1-\alpha)(\hat{p} + (1-\hat{p})(1-T_B))] \\
& + \hat{p}(1-\hat{p}) [\alpha(1-T_B) + (1-\alpha)(\hat{p} + (1-\hat{p})(1-T_B))] \\
& + (1-\hat{p})\hat{p} [\alpha T_A + (1-\alpha) \hat{p} T_A ] \\
& + (1-\hat{p})^2 [(1-\alpha) \hat{p} T_A] \;,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which simplifies to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nextgen_adults_slimpify}
p' = \hat{p}^2(T_B-T_A) + \hat{p}(1+T_A-T_B) .
\end{equation}

The frequency of $A$ among parents (i.e. after selection) follows a similar dynamic, but also includes the effect of natural selection, and is therefore
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nextgen_parents}
\begin{aligned}
\bar{w} \tilde{p}'
& = \hat{p}^2 (1+b-c) [\alpha + (1-\alpha)(\hat{p} + (1-\hat{p})(1-T_B))] \\
& + \hat{p}(1-\hat{p}) (1-c) [\alpha(1-T_B) + (1-\alpha)(\hat{p} + (1-\hat{p})(1-T_B))] \\
& + (1-\hat{p})\hat{p} (1+b) [\alpha T_A + (1-\alpha) \hat{p} T_A ] \\
& + (1-\hat{p})^2 [(1-\alpha) \hat{p} T_A] \;,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where fitness values are taken from \autoref{table:prisoner_payoff} and \autoref{table:interactions}, and the population mean fitness is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mean_fitness}
\bar{w} =  1 + \hat{p}(b-c).
\end{equation}

\autoref{eq:nextgen_parents} can be simplified to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nextgen_parents_simplified}
\begin{aligned}
\bar{w} \tilde{p}'
& = \hat{p}^2 (1+b-c) \big(1-(1-\hat{p})(1-\alpha)T_B)\big) \\
& + \hat{p}(1-\hat{p}) (1-c) \big(\hat{p}(1-\alpha)T_B+1-T_B\big) \\
& + (1-\hat{p})\hat{p} (1+b) \big(\hat{p}(1-\alpha) + \alpha\big) T_A \\
& + (1-\hat{p})^2 \hat{p} (1-\alpha) T_A \;.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{p}=v\tilde{p}+(1-v)p$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Oblique and Horizontal Transmission}

With only oblique and horizontal transmission, i.e. $v = 0$, Eq.\ \ref{eq:horizontal} becomes $\hat{p}=p$ and Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_adults_slimpify} becomes % TODO check this, I changed the ref from nextgen_parents_simplified to nextgen_adults_slimpify
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:nextgen_parents_oblique_only}
p' = p^2 (T_B-T_A) + p (1+T_A-T_B) ,
\end{equation}

which gives the following result.\\

\begin{result}[Oblique and horizontal transmission of cooperation] \label{result:obli_hori}
Without vertical transmission ($v=0$), if there is a horizontal transmission bias in favor of cooperation, namely
\begin{equation} \label{eq:oblique_only_result}
T_A > T_B, 
\end{equation}
then $p'>p$, and the frequency of the cooperator phenotype among adults increases every generation.
\end{result}

If $T_A = T_B$, then $p'=p$ and the population is static.
Therefore, in the absence of vertical transmission, selection plays no role in the evolution of cooperation. Hence, cooperation will evolve if the cooperator phenotype has a horizontal transmission bias (see~{\autoref{fig:results}c).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Vertical and Horizontal Transmission}

With only vertical and horizontal transmission, i.e. $v=1$, Eq.\ \ref{eq:horizontal} becomes
$\hat{p} =  \tilde{p}$,
and Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_parents_simplified} for the frequency of the cooperative phenotype among parents in the next generation $\tilde{p}'$ can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:nextgen_parents_vertical_only} 
\begin{aligned}
\bar{w} \tilde{p}' 
& = \tilde{p}^2 (1+b-c) [1 - (1-\tilde{p}) (1-\alpha) T_B] \\
& + \tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p}) (1-c) [\tilde{p} (1-\alpha) T_B + 1 - T_B] \\
& + \tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p}) (1+b) [\tilde{p} (1-\alpha) + \alpha] T_A \\
& + (1-\tilde{p})^2 \tilde{p} (1-\alpha) T_A .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Fixation of either cooperation, $\tilde{p}=1$, or defection, 
$\tilde{p}=0$, are equilibria of Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_parents_vertical_only}, that is, they solve $\tilde{p}'= \tilde{p}$.
We therefore assume for the remainder of the analysis that $0<\tilde{p}<1$.

If $\alpha=1$, then $\tilde{p}'= \tilde{p}$ is reduced to
\begin{equation}
\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})\big[(1+b)T_A + (1-c)(1-T_B)-1\big] = 0,
\end{equation}
and there are no additional equilibria.
For cooperation to take over the population (for $\tilde{p}=1$ to be globally stable) we require $\tilde{p}'>\tilde{p}$; that is,
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{p}^2 (1+b-c) + \tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p}) \big[(1-c) (1 - T_B) + (1+b)T_A\big] 
  > \bar{w}\tilde{p} .
\end{equation}
Factoring out $\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})$ and setting $\bar{w} = 1 + \tilde{p}(b-c)$, we find that $\hat{p}'>\hat{p}$ if
%\begin{equation}
%  (1-\tilde{p}) \big[(1-c) (1 - T_B) + (1+b)T_A\big] 
%  > 1 -\tilde{p} .
%\end{equation}
%Dividing by $(1-\tilde{p})$ we find that $\tilde{p}'>\tilde{p}$ if 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vert_hori_alpha1_condition_proof}
  (1-c) (1 - T_B) + (1+b)T_A
  > 1
\end{equation}
\\

If $\alpha<1$, divide both sides of Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_parents_vertical_only} by $\tilde{p}$ and set $\bar{w} = 1 + \tilde{p}(b-c)$. Then $\tilde{p}'>\tilde{p}$ if
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
  1 + \tilde{p}(b-c) < 
  & \, \tilde{p}(1+b-c) (1 - (1-\tilde{p}) (1-\alpha) T_B) \\
  & + (1-\tilde{p}) (1-c) (\tilde{p} (1-\alpha) T_B + 1 - T_B) \\
  & + (1-\tilde{p}) (1+b) (\tilde{p} (1-\alpha) + \alpha) T_A \\
  & + (1-\tilde{p})^2 (1-\alpha) T_A .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%Rearranging, we get
%\begin{equation} 
%\begin{aligned} 
%  1 - \tilde{p} < 
%  & - \tilde{p}(1+b-c)(1-\tilde{p}) (1-\alpha) T_B \\
%  & + (1-\tilde{p}) (1-c) (\tilde{p} (1-\alpha) T_B + 1 - T_B) \\
%  & + (1-\tilde{p}) (1+b) (\tilde{p} (1-\alpha) + \alpha) T_A \\
%  & + (1-\tilde{p})^2 (1-\alpha) T_A .
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%Diving by $(1-\tilde{p})$ and rearranging so that free terms are on the left and terms with $\tilde{p}$ are on the right, we have
%\begin{equation} 
%\begin{aligned} 
%  &1 - (1-\alpha) T_A - (1+b) \alpha T_A - (1 - T_B)(1-c)  < \\
%   &\tilde{p}[ - (1+b-c) (1-\alpha) T_B 
%   + (1-c) (1-\alpha) T_B
%   + (1+b) (1-\alpha) T_A 
%   - (1-\alpha) T_A].
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
Simplifying, we find that $\tilde{p}'>\tilde{p}$ if and only if
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vert_hori_global_condition}
c(1-T_B) - b \alpha T_A - (T_A-T_B) < \tilde{p} \cdot b (1-\alpha) (T_A-T_B).
\end{equation}

Besides the fixation states $\tilde{p}=0$ and $\tilde{p}=1$, there may be an actual polymorphic equilibrium of $\tilde{p}'=\tilde{p}$ in Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_parents_vertical_only}, namely 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vert_hori_equilibrium}
  \tilde{p}^* = 
  \frac{c(1-T_B) - b \alpha T_A - (T_A-T_B)}{b (1-\alpha) (T_A-T_B)} ,
\end{equation} 
which is legitimate if $0<\tilde{p}^*<1$.

Since all parameters are positive, we can apply
inequality \ref{eq:vert_hori_global_condition} and see that for $\tilde{p}'>\tilde{p}$ we require that either 
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:vert_hori_global_condition1}
T_A > T_B \quad&\text{and}\quad \tilde{p}>\tilde{p}^*,  \quad \text{or} \\
\label{eq:vert_hori_global_condition2}
T_A <T_B \quad&\text{and}\quad \tilde{p}<\tilde{p}^* .
\end{align}

We define the initial frequency of the cooperator phenotype among parents, $\tilde{p}_0$, and the \emph{cost boundaries},
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_boundaries}
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_1 = \frac{b \alpha T_A + (T_A - T_B)}{1-T_B}, \quad
\gamma_2 = \frac{b \alpha T_B + (1+b) (T_A - T_B)}{1-T_B}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Then, applying Eqs.~\ref{eq:vert_hori_equilibrium}, \ref{eq:vert_hori_global_condition1}, and \ref{eq:vert_hori_global_condition2}, we  summarize the possible outcomes in following result and corollaries.
\\

\begin{result}[Vertical and horizontal transmission of cooperation] \label{result:vert_hori}
With vertical and horizontal but without oblique transmission ($v=1$), the cultural evolution of a cooperator phenotype will follow one of the following scenarios, depending on the cost boundaries $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (\autoref{eq:cost_boundaries}):

These conditions are illustrated in \autoref{fig:results2}.
Note that cooperation and defection can coexist stably if there is horizontal bias for defection and the cost of cooperation is large but not too large. The recursion dynamic for this case is illustrated in \autoref{fig:coexistence_without_oblique}.

Much of the literature on evolution of cooperation focuses on conditions for an initially rare cooperative phenotype to invade a population of defectors.
The next corollary deals with such a condition, followed by a corollary that deals with symmetric horizontal transmission, i.e. $T_A=T_B$.
\\

\begin{corollary}[Condition for cooperation to increase when initially rare]
If the initial frequency of the cooperative phenotype is very close to zero, $\tilde{p}_0 \approx 0$, then this frequency will increase if 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:unequal_transmission_from_rarity}
\begin{aligned}
T_A>T_B \;\; \text{and} \;\; c < \gamma_1, \quad \text{or} \quad
T_A<T_B \;\; \text{and} \;\; \gamma_2<c < \gamma_1. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
\end{corollary}

In general, these conditions cannot be formulated in the form of Hamilton's rule ($c<b\cdot r$) due to the horizontal transmission bias $T_A-T_B$.
Without horizontal transmission bias, i.e., with $T=T_A=T_B$, these conditions reduce to a form of Hamilton's rule.\\

\begin{corollary}[Symmetric horizontal transmission]
If $T=T_A=T_B$, then cooperation will take over the population if
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equal_transmission}
c < b \cdot \alpha \frac{T}{1-T}.
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}
Inequality \ref{eq:equal_transmission} is obtained by setting $T=T_A=T_B$ in inequality \ref{eq:vert_hori_global_condition} and can be interpreted as a version of Hamilton's rule (inequality~\ref{eq:hamilton_rule}) or as a version of inequality~\ref{eq:fletcher2009}, where $\alpha T/(1-T)$ can be regarded as the `effective relatedness' or `effective assortment', respectively.
\autoref{fig:results}a demonstrates this condition. 
\\

\begin{corollary}[No assortment of transmission and cooperation]
Without assortment ($\alpha=0$) and with horizontal bias for cooperation ($T_A>T_B$), then 
(1) if the cost is low compared to the bias ($c<(T_A-T_B)/(1-T_B)$), then cooperation will fix from any positive frequency; 
(2) if the cost is low compared to the benefit ($c<(1+b)(T_A-T_B)(1-T_B)$), then cooperation will fix if the initial frequency is high enough ($\tilde{p}_0 > \tilde{p}^*$).
\end{corollary}

\autoref{fig:results2}a illustrates these conditions, where
 the third equilibrium given by Eq.\ \ref{eq:vert_hori_equilibrium} becomes
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vert_hori_alpha0_equilibrium}
\tilde{p}^*(\alpha=0) = \frac{c(1-T_B) - (T_A-T_B)}{b (T_A-T_B) },
\end{equation} 
and the cost boundaries are
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\gamma_1(\alpha=0) = \frac{T_A - T_B}{1-T_B}, \quad
\gamma_2(\alpha=0) = (1+b)\frac{T_A - T_B}{1-T_B}.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
If $T_A>T_B$ then $0<\gamma_1(\alpha=0)<\gamma_2(\alpha=0)$.
So either $c<\gamma_1(\alpha=0)$ or $\gamma_1(\alpha=0)<c<\gamma_2(\alpha=0)$ will allow fixation of cooperation, the latter only if the initial frequency is high enough.
If $T_A<T_B$ then $\gamma_2(\alpha=0)<\gamma_1(\alpha=0)<0<c$,
and defection will fix.
%TODO add "effective cost" argument: c<TA-TB/(1-TB) <=> 1-(1-c)(1-TB)<TA.
\\

\begin{corollary}[Perfect assortment of transmission and cooperation]
With perfect assortment ($\alpha=1$), there are only two equilibria, $\tilde{p}=0$ and $\tilde{p}=1$.
The condition for evolution of cooperation (i.e. global stability of $\tilde{p}=1$) is found from inequality \ref{eq:vert_hori_alpha1_condition_proof}, namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vert_hori_alpha1}
c < \frac{b \cdot T_A + (T_A - T_B)}{1-T_B}.
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}
With perfect assortment horizontal transmission always co-occurs with the cooperative interaction. The same occurs in \citet{lewin2017microbes}, and therefore this corollary is equivalent to their result (see their eq.~1).

In terms of the cost boundaries, inequality~\ref{eq:vert_hori_alpha1} is equivalent to $c<\gamma_1$, and if $T_A>T_B$ then that suffices for fixation of cooperation. If $T_B>T_A$ then $\gamma_2(\alpha=1)<0$ and again, inequality~\ref{eq:vert_hori_alpha1} is sufficient for increase in the frequency of $A$.
Inequality~\ref{eq:vert_hori_alpha1} can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vert_hori_alpha1_effective}
1 - (1-c)(1-T_B) < (1+b) T_A ,
\end{equation}
which provides an interesting interpretation for the success of cooperation. 
In the interaction between a cooperator and a defector, $(1-c)(1-T_B)$ is the probability that the cooperator remains cooperative and also reproduces. 
Therefore, $1 - (1-c)(1-T_B)$ is the probability that either the cooperator becomes a defector, or that it fails to reproduce.
This is the \emph{effective cost of cooperation} from this interaction, while $(1+b) T_A$ is the probability that the defector becomes cooperative and reproduces, which is the \emph{effective benefit of cooperation} from this interaction.
Thus, inequality~\ref{eq:vert_hori_alpha1} entails that cooperation can evolve if the effective cost of cooperation is less than the effective benefit.

Given the previous two corollaries for no assortment and perfect assortment ($\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=1$), it is interesting to examine the general effect of assortment on the evolution of cooperation.
We denote the assortment boundaries by
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}\label{eq:boundries_assortative_meeting}
  a_1 = \frac{c(1-T_B)-(1+b)(T_A-T_B)}{b\cdot T_B}, \quad
  a_2 = \frac{c(1-T_B)-(T_A-T_B)}{b\cdot T_A}.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Applying Eqs.~\ref{eq:vert_hori_equilibrium}, \ref{eq:vert_hori_global_condition1}, and \ref{eq:vert_hori_global_condition2}, we have the following corollary.
\\

\begin{corollary}[Intermediate assortment of transmission and cooperation]
The cooperative phenotype will increase from rarity if the assortment rate is high enough, or specifically if
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:unequal_transmission_from_rarity_in_alpha_terms}
    \begin{aligned}
    T_A > T_B &\;\; \text{and} \;\; a_2 < \alpha, \quad \text{or} \\
    T_A < T_B &\;\; \text{and} \;\; a_1 < \alpha \,.
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation} 
\end{corollary}

\autoref{fig:results2}c demonstrates these conditions. With horizontal bias for cooperation ($T_A>T_B$; positive x-axis) cooperation fixes in the population from any initial positive frequency (green) if $\alpha$ (y-axis) is above the orange line ($a_1$), or if initially present at a high enough frequency (blue) if $\alpha$ is above the blue line ($a_2$).
With horizontal bias for defection ($T_B>T_A$; negative x-axis) cooperation fixes if $\alpha$ is above the blue line ($a_2$), but can be maintained in coexistence with defection (yellow) if $\alpha$ is above the orange line ($a_1$). Without horizontal bias ($T_A=T_B$) fixation occurs if the assortment rate is high enough, $\alpha > \frac{c}{b} \cdot \frac{1-T}{T}$ (inequality~\ref{eq:equal_transmission}).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{With Vertical and Oblique Transmission}

With both vertical and oblique transmission, $0<v<1$, the recursion system is more complex,
and we focus on local rather than on global stability.
To proceed, we note that 
Eq.\ \ref{eq:horizontal} can give $\hat{p}'$ as a function of both $p'$ and $\tilde{p}'$.
%Equation 4 does not give $\hat{p}$---MF
Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_adults_slimpify} gives $p'$ as a function of $\tilde{p}$, since $\hat{p}$ is given in Eq.\ \ref{eq:horizontal} as a function of $\tilde{p}$ and 
Eq.\ \ref{eq:nextgen_parents_simplified} gives $\tilde{p}'$ as a function of $\hat{p}$. 
Combining these equations, we find an equation for $\hat{p}'$ as a function of $\hat{p}$ (shown in Appendix~\autoref{sec:appendixA}).
We then determine the equilibria, namely, solutions of $\hat{p}' = \hat{p}$, and analyse their local stability.
%: an equilibrium $\hat{p}^*$ is locally stable when the derivative of $f(\hat{p})=\bar{w}(\hat{p}'-\hat{p})$ at the equilibrium is negative, $f'(\hat{p}^*)<0$. 

%We start with the simple case of symmetrical horizontal transmission, $T=T_A=T_B$ and apply \autoref{eq:horizontal}, \autoref{eq:nextgen_adults_slimpify}, and \autoref{eq:nextgen_parents_simplified} to obtain 
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:equal_horizontal_transmission}
%\begin{aligned}
%  f(\hat{p}) &= 
%  \bar{w}(\hat{p}' - \hat{p}) = \\
%  &\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\big[\alpha bvT - cv(1-T)\big].\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%A detailed explain of how we get eq.~\ref{eq:equal_horizontal_transmission} can be found in appendix B.
%The equilibria are solutions of $f(\hat{p})=0$, or $\hat{p}' = \hat{p}$.
%It is easy to verify that fixation of either phenotype, $\hat{p} =  0$ and $\hat{p} = 1$, is an equilibrium.
%Since the derivative of $f'(\hat{p}$ is 
%\begin{equation}
%f'(\hat{p})=(1-2\hat{p})\big[\alpha bvT - cv(1-T)\big],
%\end{equation}
%then the condition for local stability of $\hat{p}=1$ is
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:derivative_of_phattag-phat}
%	f'(1) =	-\alpha bvT + cv(1-T) < 0,
%\end{equation}
%which gives the following result.
%
%\textbf{Result 3: Oblique and vertical transmission with symmetric horizontal transmission.}
%If horizontal transmission is symmetric, $T = T_A = T_B$, and if
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:oblique_and_vertic_result2}
%  %\frac{b}{c}>\frac{1-T}{\alpha T}
%	c < b \cdot \frac{\alpha T}{1-T},
%\end{equation}
%then fixation of the cooperator phenotype $A$ is locally stable.
%The same condition was given in Corollary 1.1, \autoref{eq:equal_transmission}.

%We now turn to the general case where $T_A \neq T_B$. 
We apply Eqs.\ \ref{eq:horizontal}, \ref{eq:nextgen_adults_slimpify}, and \ref{eq:nextgen_parents_simplified} to obtain the function $f(\hat{p})$ (see Appendix~\autoref{sec:appendixA}):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:general_case_polynomial}
  f(\hat{p}) = \bar{w}(\hat{p}'-\hat{p}) =
  \beta_1 \hat{p}^3 + \beta_2 \hat{p}^2 + \beta_3 \hat{p},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:polynomial_coefficients}
\begin{aligned}
\beta_1 &= \big[c(1-v) - b (1-\alpha v)\big] (T_A-T_B) , \\
\beta_2 &= -\beta_1 -\beta_3 ,  \\
\beta_3 &= \alpha bvT_A - cv(1-T_B) + (T_A-T_B) .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If $T=T_A=T_B$ then $\beta_1=0$ and $\beta_3=-\beta_2=\alpha b vT -cv(1-T)$, 
and $f(\hat{p})$ becomes a quadratic polynomial:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:equal_horizontal_transmission}
  f(\hat{p}) = \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\big[\alpha bvT - cv(1-T)\big].
\end{equation}
Clearly the only two equilibria are the fixations  $\hat{p} =  0$ and $\hat{p} = 1$.
These equilibria are locally stable if $f'(\hat{p})<0$ near the equilibrium (Appendix~\autoref{sec:appendixB}), and
\begin{equation}
f'(\hat{p})=(1-2\hat{p})\big[\alpha bvT - cv(1-T)\big],
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation} \label{eq:derivative_of_phattag-phat}
\begin{aligned}
	f'(0) &=	\alpha bvT - cv(1-T), \\
	f'(1) &=	-\alpha bvT + cv(1-T).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Therefore with symmetric horizontal transmission, fixation of the cooperative phenotype ($\hat{p}=1$) occurs under the same condition as Corollary 1.1, namely Eq.\ \ref{eq:equal_transmission}.


In the general case where $T_A \neq T_B$, the coefficient $\beta_1$ is not necessarily zero, and $f(\hat{p})$ is a cubic polynomial.
Therefore, three equilibria may exist, two of which are
$\hat{p} = 0 $ and $\hat{p} = 1$, and the third is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:oblique_and_vertic_result}
  \hat{p}^* =  
  \frac{\beta_3}{\beta_1}.
\end{equation}

Note that the sign of the  cubic (Eq.\ \ref{eq:general_case_polynomial}) at positive (negative) infinity is equal (opposite) to the sign of $\beta_1$. 
If $T_A>T_B$, then 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:beta1}
   \beta_1 < [c(1-\alpha v) - b(1-\alpha v)] (T_A-T_B) 
   = (1-\alpha v)(c-b)(T_A-T_B) < 0 ,
 \end{equation}
since $c<b$ and $1>\alpha v$. Hence the signs of the cubic at positive and negative infinity are negative and positive, respectively.
First, if $\beta_3<\beta_1$ then 
$1<\hat{p}^*$ and therefore $f'(0)<0$ and $f'(1)>0$; that is, fixation of the defector phenotype $B$ is the only locally stable legitimate (i.e. between 0 and 1) equilibrium.
Second, if $\beta_1<\beta_3<0$ then 
$0<\hat{p}^*<1$ and therefore $f'(0)<0$ and $f'(1)<0$, that is, both fixations are locally stable and $\hat{p}^*$ separates the domains of attraction.
Third, if $0<\beta_3$ then 
$\hat{p}^*<0$ and therefore $f'(0)>0$ and $f'(1)<0$; that is, fixation of the cooperator phenotype $A$ is the only locally stable legitimate equilibrium.

Similarly, if $T_B>T_A$, then
\begin{equation} \label{eq:beta1_rev}
   \beta_1 > [c(1-\alpha v) - b(1-\alpha v)] (T_A-T_B) 
   = (1-\alpha v)(c-b)(T_A-T_B) > 0,
 \end{equation}
since $c<b$ and $1>\alpha v$, and the signs of the cubic at positive and negative infinity are positive and negative, respectively. 
First, if $\beta_3<0$ then $\hat{p}^*<0$ and therefore $f'(0)<0$ and $f'(1)>0$; that is, fixation of the defector phenotype $A=B$ is the only locally stable legitimate equilibrium.
Second, if $0<\beta_3<\beta_1$ then $0<\hat{p}^*<1$ and therefore $f'(0)>0$ and $f'(1)>0$; that is, both fixations are locally unstable and $\hat{p}^*$ is a stable polymorphic equilibrium.
Third, if $\beta_1<\beta_3$ then $\hat{p}^*>1$ and therefore $f'(0)>0$ and $f'(1)<0$, and fixation of the cooperator phenotype $A$ is the only locally stable legitimate equilibrium.

We define new cost boundaries, $\hat\gamma_1$ and $\hat\gamma_2$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cost_boundaries_v}
\begin{aligned}
\hat\gamma_1 = \frac{b v \alpha T_A + (T_A - T_B)}{v(1-T_B)}, \quad
\hat\gamma_2 = \frac{b v \alpha T_B + (1+b) (T_A - T_B)}{v(1-T_B) + (1-v)(T_A-T_B)},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and define a vertical transmission threshold,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:v_threshold}
\hat v = \frac{T_B - T_A}{1-T_A} \,.
\end{equation}

The following result summarizes the possible outcomes.
\\

\begin{result}[Vertical, oblique, and horizontal transmission of cooperation] \label{result:vert_obli_hori}
With vertical, horizontal, and oblique transmission, the cultural evolution of a cooperator phenotype will follow one of the following scenarios depending on the cost boundaries $\hat\gamma_1$ and $\hat\gamma_2$ (\autoref{eq:cost_boundaries_v}) and the vertical threshold $\hat v$ (\autoref{eq:v_threshold}) :

% Discussion
\section*{Discussion}
We studied the evolution of cooperation under non-vertical transmission using deterministic discrete-time evolutionary models with fitnesses in the form of payoffs from a prisoner's dilemma game. 
Under oblique and horizontal cultural transmission, a horizontal transmission bias for the cooperative phenotype was found to be sufficient and necessary for evolution of cooperation (Result~\autoref{result:obli_hori}).
Under a combination of vertical, oblique, and horizontal transmission, cooperation or defection can either fix or coexist at a stable polymorphism, depending on the relationship between the cost and benefit of cooperation, the horizontal bias, and the association between cooperation and transmission (Results~\autoref{result:vert_hori} and~\autoref{result:vert_obli_hori}).
Remarkably, stable coexistence between cooperation and defection can be maintained if horizontal transmission is biased for defection ($T_B>T_A$) and both the cost of cooperation and social association are intermediate (yellow areas in \autoref{fig:results2}).
% TODO figure for result 3
% TODO something about v-hat

\citet{feldman1985gene} studied the dynamics of an altruistic phenotype with vertical cultural transmission and a gene that modifies the transmission of the phenotype. Their results are very sensitive to this genetic modification: without it, the conditions for invasion of the altruistic phenotype reduce to Hamilton's rule.
Further work is needed to include such genetic modification of cultural transmission to our model.

\citet{woodcock2006significance} has previously argued the significance of non-vertical transmission for the evolution of cooperation. He executed simulations with prisoner's dilemma payoffs but without horizontal transmission or social association ($\alpha=0$). Nevertheless, his results demonstrated that it is possible to sustain altruistic behavior via cultural transmission for a significant duration of time.
Our results provide strong evidence for his hypothesis that horizontal transmission could have an important role in the evolution of cooperation. 

To understand the role of horizontal transmission, we first discuss the role of \emph{assortment}.
\citet{Eshel1982} showed that altruism can evolve when there is enough \emph{assortative meeting}, namely, a tendency for individuals to interact within their phenotypic group.
\citet{Fletcher2009assortment} have further argued that a general explanation for the evolution of altruism is given by \emph{assortment}: the correlation between individuals that carry an altruistic trait and the amount of altruistic behavior in their interaction group.
They therefore suggested that to explain the evolution of altruism, we should seek mechanisms that generate such assortment, like population structure, repeated interactions, and individual recognition.
Our results highlight another mechanism for generating assortment: an association between social interactions and horizontal transmission that creates a correlation between one's partner for interaction and partner for transmission.
This mechanism does not require population structure, repeated interactions, or individual recognition.
We show that high levels of such social association greatly increase the potential for evolution of cooperation (\autoref{fig:results2}).
With enough social association ($\alpha > \big(c(1-T_B) + (T_B-T_A)\big) / b T_A$), cooperation can increase in frequency when initially rare even when there is horizontal transmission bias against it ($T_B>T_A$, see Result~\autoref{result:vert_hori}).

How does non-vertical transmission generate assortment? 
\citet{lewin2017microbes} and \citet{lewin2020rockpaperscissors}, 
who suggested that microbes that manipulate their hosts to act altruistically can be favored by selection, and may help explain the evolution of cooperation. 
%Indeed, it has been shown that microbes can mediate behavioral changes in their  hosts~\citep{dobson1988population,poulin2010parasite}. 
%Therefore, natural selection on microbes may favor manipulation of the host so that it cooperates with others. 
From the kin selection point-of-view, if microbes can be transmitted \emph{horizontally} from one host to another during host interactions, then following horizontal transmission the recipient host will carry microbes that are closely related to the microbes of the donor host, 
even when the two hosts are (genetically) unrelated. 
However, we are more interested in the assortment point-of-view:
infection by behavior-determining microbes during interactions effectively generates assortment because receipient of help may be infected by the behavior-determining microbe and therefore become a helper.
Cultural horizontal transmission can similarly generate assortment between the cooperative phenotype and the benefit of cooperation if cultural transmission and helping interactions occur between the same individuals, which in our model occurs with probability $\alpha$. 

Thus, with horizontal transmission, ``assortment between focal cooperative players and cooperative acts in their interaction
environment''~\citep{Fletcher2009assortment} is generated not because \emph{the helper is likely to be helped}, but rather because \emph{the helped is likely to become a helper}.
These conclusions highlight the importance of non-vertical cultural transmission for explaining complex evolutionary phenomena, and  furthers our understating of the cultural evolution of cooperation.

\section{} \label{sec:appendixA}
We want to find the frequency of juveniles with phenotype $A$ in next generation $\hat{p}'$ as a function of frequency
of juveniles with phenotype $A$ in the current generation $\hat{p}$.
Starting from \autoref{eq:horizontal},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:appendix_b_1}
  \hat{p}' = v \tilde{p}' + (1-v) p',
\end{equation}
we substitute $p'$ using \autoref{eq:nextgen_adults_slimpify} and $\tilde{p}'$ using \autoref{eq:nextgen_parents_simplified}, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:appendix_b_2}
  \begin{aligned}
  \hat{p}'  = & \frac{v}{\bar{w}}\left\{\hat{p}^2(1+b-c)\left[1-(1-\hat{p})(1-\alpha)T_B)\right]\right\} \\

\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{w} = 1 + \hat{p}(b-c)$. 
We define $f(\hat{p})$ as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:appendix_define_f}
\begin{aligned}
      f(\hat{p}) &= \bar{w}(\hat{p}' - \hat{p})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Using \emph{SymPy} \citep{Meurer2017}, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, we simplify \autoref{eq:appendix_define_f} to 
eqs.~\ref{eq:general_case_polynomial}-\ref{eq:polynomial_coefficients}.

\section{} \label{sec:appendixB}

Denote $f(p)=\lambda(p'-p)$, where $\lambda>0$, and assume $f(p^*)=0$; i.e., $p^*$ is an equilibrium.
%HOW DO YOU KNOW $p^*\in(0,1)$?--MF
We want a condition for $|p'-p^*| < |p-p^*|$.

If $p>p^*=0$, we want a condition for $p'<p$, or
$\frac{p'}{p}<1$, or
$\lambda \frac{p'-p}{p} < 0$, or
$\frac{f(p)}{p} < 0$.
Using a linear approximation for $f(p)$ near $0$, we have
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p' &< p \Leftrightarrow \\
\frac{f'(0) \cdot p + O(p^2)}{p} &< 0 \Leftrightarrow \\
f'(0) + O(p) &< 0.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Therefore, by definition of big-O notation, if $f'(0)<0$ then there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that for any $0<p<\epsilon$, it is guaranteed that $0<p'<p$, that is, $p'$ is closer than $p$ to zero.

If $p<p^*=1$, we want a condition for $1-p' < 1-p$, or
$\frac{1-p'}{1-p}<1$, or
$\lambda \frac{-(p'-p)}{1-p} < 0$, or
$-\frac{f(p)}{1-p} < 0$.
Using a linear approximation for $f(p)$ near $1$, we have
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
1-p' &< 1-p  \Leftrightarrow \\
\frac{f'(1)(p-1) + O\big((p-1)^2\big)}{p-1} &< 0 \Leftrightarrow \\
f'(1) - O(1-p) &< 0.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
Therefore, if $f'(1)<0$ then there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that for any $1-\epsilon<1-p<1$ it is guaranteed that $1-p'<1-p$, that is, $p'$ is closer than $p$ to one.

%%% Figure: coexistence map - without oblique transmission
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics{coexistence_without_oblique.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Stable and unstable coexistence between cooperation and defection without oblique transmission.}
  The curves show the frequency of the cooperative phenotype $A$ among parents in the next generation $\tilde{p}'$ vs. the current generation $\tilde{p}$ (\autoref{eq:nextgen_parents_vertical_only}).
  The dashed black line is $\tilde{p}'=\tilde{p}$.
  The curves and the dashed line intersect at the polymorphic equilibrium $\tilde{p}^*$ (black circle).
  When the curves are above the dashed line, $\tilde'{p}>\tilde{p}$, then $\tilde{p}$ increase.
  When the curves are below the dashed line, $\tilde'{p}<\tilde{p}$, then $\tilde{p}$ decreases.
  The orange curve, for which the polymorphic equilibrium is stable, is given by $T_A = 0.4$, $T_B = 0.9$, $b = 12$, $c=0.35$, and $\alpha = 0.45$, which give $\gamma_2<c<\gamma_1$ (\autoref{eq:cost_boundaries})
  The blue curve, for which the equilibrium is unstable, is given by $T_A = 0.5$, $T_B = 0.1$, $b = 1.3$, $c=0.904$, and $\alpha = 0.4$, which give $\gamma_1<c<\gamma_2$.
  In both cases there is no oblique transmission, $v=1$; see \autoref{fig:coexistence_with_oblique} for $v<1$.
